Human Activity Recognition using machine learning is an application to detect human activity, normally in day-to-day life, such as sitting, laying, standing, and walking. 

This is achieved using models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K Nearest Neighbour, by which the machine can understand and deliver the outcome with respect to human activities. 

I upload SVM and HPT File, KNN Model File, Activities prediction file, Svm Model Accuracy file

The machine can learn and predict the controls of  humans and send the output to the user.  The framework can also be implemented to ensure the feature of portable, because the outcome can also be shown on the web page.
